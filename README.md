# C210104_IntroductionToShaderProgramming

Final Submission.

Having been inspired by one of the levels in the Ghostrunner game,
I attempted to create a cyber/glitch-shader. (Reference Footage in: /Assets/Shaders/LP/...)

There are 2, very similar, variants of it.
The main one:
--> /Assets/Shaders/LP/LP_GlitchLiquid
This is the one I mainly worked on and can be seen on the plane in the scene 'LP_ShaderShowcase' ( /Assets/Shaders/LP/..)

--> /Assets/Shaders/LP/LP_GlitchBall
This one uses the same foundation as the one above, though here it's made to work on a sphere.


As for the Shaders I created during the lessons. They can all be seen in the aforementioned scene.
The graphs themselves can be found under /Assets/Shaders/LP/...
in their respective folders. (Day 1-5)

In case there are any questions in regards to my submission, 
please feel free to contact me.
